    "One of the most popular algorithm for Constraint Based Structure Learning is the PC algorithm. The PC algorithm starts with a fully connect undirected graph over all the nodes in the model, and then iteratively removes edges from this graph by finding the minimal conditioning set to d-separate the variables of the edge. The steps can be summerized as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with a fully connected graph\n",
    "2. Iterate over the edges to find the minimal conditioning set by doing conditional independence tests on the given dataset.\n",
    "3. If a conditining set is found, remove that edge from the model.\n",
    "4. Go back to step 2, until no more conditining set can be found.\n",

    "The first step is to initialize the estimator class by giving it the dataset and the type of conditional independence test that will be used. Want to use your own CI test? Read the last section. Once, that is done, the estimate method can be called to estimate a DAG structure from the dataset. The variant argument controls which variant of the algorithm will be used. Want to use your own implementation of the learning algorithm? Read the last section. The max_conditional_variables control the maximum number of elements allowed in the conditioning set. This has an effect on the statistical test for independence. For example, chisquare test can become very inaccurate if the number of conditional variables are too high. If the variant being used is `parallel`, you can also specify the number of threads to be run. Since `stable` and `orig` variants run on a single thread, it doesn't need to be specified in that case.
